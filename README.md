confuscate
==========

Abusive Javascript code obfuscation. Runs with node.js.  
This is a modified version of [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).  
Prettifies your code, but replaces all variable and function names with abusive language.

Usage: `node confuscate /path/to/filename.js > /path/to/new_filename.js`
